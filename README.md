# EMOTION_DETECTION
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions from facial images. It classifies faces into seven emotionsâ€”angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. A Gradio web interface lets users upload an image and get real-time emotion predictions.
